## Goal Setting

At the beginning of a day, write 2-5 goals you want to achieve today. At the end of the day, reflect in writing on your progress toward meeting your goals. In order to craft daily goals that help you become a better developer, your goals must be ambitious, yet feasible and describe *how* to get the work done.

### Goals

The beginning of the reflection includes 2-5 measurable goals that were set at the beginning of the day. Actionable goals are SMART:

* [ ] **S**pecific
* [ ] **M**easurable: At the end of a specified time period, it is easy to determine whether or not the goal has been met
* [ ] **A**chievable: It is possible to attain your daily goal
* [ ] **R**ealistic 
* [ ] **T**imely: Your goals are what you need to learn now. 

### Reflection

The following questions are answered in writing:

* [ ] Were the goals met? Yes or no.
* [ ] What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes _why_ these actions were a 'win.'
* [ ] What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and  describes _why_ the goal wasn't met.   
* [ ] What will you do differently tomorrow?
